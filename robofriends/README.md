This is a React Web Application just for learning stuff!!!

This project uses two API 
1.https://robohash.org/ 
  which gives a user a random image of robot.
2.https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
  which is REST API for developers for testing purpose.
  
  Else this uses a Tachyons package which alows user to use inbuilt classes for designing purpose just
  like Bootstrap if you are known to it.
  
  Well enjoy editing it!!!!!!!
